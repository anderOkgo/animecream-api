Hexagonal Architecture, TypeScript, Node.js, JavaScript, Clean Code, and SOLID principles
This repository contains a sample application that demonstrates the use of Hexagonal Architecture, TypeScript, Node.js, JavaScript, Clean Code, and SOLID principles.

Hexagonal Architecture
Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters Architecture, is a software design pattern that decouples the application's domain logic from its dependencies. This makes the application more flexible and adaptable to change.

TypeScript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds type safety, classes, interfaces, and other features that make it a more powerful and expressive language.

Node.js
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is a popular choice for developing web applications, but it can also be used for a wide variety of other tasks, such as building microservices, creating serverless applications, and developing IoT devices.

JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create interactive web pages. It is also used to develop a wide variety of other applications, such as mobile apps, desktop apps, and games.

Clean Code
Clean Code is a set of principles and practices that can be used to write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.

SOLID principles
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that can be used to create object-oriented software that is more robust, flexible, and maintainable.
